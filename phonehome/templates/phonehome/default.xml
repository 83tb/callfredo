  <Say>Hi {{ user.get_full_name }}, what a nice weather today in Warsaw! This is your daily morning show so let's see what happened on your Facebook lately. Well, it looks like you have {{ json_data.unread }} unread messages from your friends, so be sure to check that out later! Also, remember that you're going to {% for event in json_data.events %}{{ event }} {% if not forloop.last %}and{% endif %}{% endfor %} today. Time for birthdays! Your friend {{ bday }} has birthday today. We're thinking you may want to wish your friend all best, so just start talking after a beep and we'll post your wishes on his wall.</Say>
